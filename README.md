## Introduction:
This project started out as two smaller projects with the first being the ray casting and the second being the html web page design. I started with the ray casting project after watching a video by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) titled [2D Raycasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo&t=1531s). This video inspired me to not only recreate his code but to also do it in a brand new language: JavaScript. After learning the basics of JavaScript on my own I decided to give it a try, and after days of work the code was finally functional. After I had created the simple ray casting program I decided that it was missing something, and this something was a user interface. So after another couple days of teaching myself the fundamentals of html and css I headed out to complete the second half to this project. After I had finished a skeleton model of how I felt everything should look and function I set out to merge the two projects into one; this one.

## Features:
This program allows the user to mimic a simplified version of ray casting.

### Settings:
- [x] Add perimeter of boundaries to the canvas 
- [x] Select density of rays
- [x] Set boundary thickness
- [x] Set source brightness
- [x] Set source color

### Actions:
- [x] Insert boundaries by plotting coordinates
- [x] Remove boundaries by selection
- [x] Generate random boundaries
- [x] Clear canvas of any boundaries (excluding perimeter)
